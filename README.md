# ☁️ Cloud Security Implementation: IAM Hardening in AWS & Azure

### 🔒 Least Privilege Access | NIST 800-53 Compliance | Zero Trust Architecture

This project presents a complete IAM (Identity and Access Management) implementation across **AWS** and **Azure**, focused on enforcing **least-privilege access**, aligning with **NIST 800-53**, and integrating **Zero Trust Architecture** to harden cloud environments.

## 📌 Project Overview

This initiative strengthens access control mechanisms within cloud infrastructure by:

- Reducing **excessive permissions** through precise IAM policy configurations
- Integrating **Zero Trust principles** for resource-level authentication
- Enhancing **compliance alignment** with frameworks like NIST 800-53

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

### ✅ IAM Policy Configuration
- Configured IAM policies for **50+ AWS S3 buckets and Azure VMs**
- Enforced **least-privilege access** across user roles and services

### ✅ Vulnerability Reduction
- Achieved **30% reduction** in access-related vulnerabilities (Qualys Scan Reports)
- Blocked public access to sensitive buckets, services, and resources

### ✅ Compliance Alignment
- Aligned with **NIST 800-53 Access Control** (AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-17, AC-24)
- Implemented **automated IAM audits** and access lifecycle management

### ✅ Zero Trust Architecture
- Enforced **MFA**, just-in-time (JIT) access, and conditional resource-level controls
- Integrated **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** for Azure elevated accounts

---

## 📊 Security Dashboard Highlights

- **Real-time visualizations** of access control metrics and IAM logs
- IAM audit logs showing access attempts, denied requests, and policy changes
- Vulnerability heatmaps for AWS S3, Azure VMs, and RBAC configurations

## 📚 Compliance Checklist – NIST 800-53

| Control Code | Description                                      | Status   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| AC-2         | Automated Account Management                     | ✅       |
| AC-3         | Logical Access Enforcement                        | ✅       |
| AC-6         | Least Privilege                                   | ✅       |
| AC-17        | Secure Remote Access                              | ⏳       |
| AC-24        | Authorized Access Control Decisions               | ⏳       |

🔁 **Progress:** 60% implemented with audit-ready reports

## 📂 Case Studies

### 🧾 S3 Bucket Exposure (AWS)
A prior misconfiguration allowed public read access to sensitive PII data. Remediation included:
- Enforcing **S3 Block Public Access**
- Automated detection using **AWS Config + Lambda**

### 🧾 VM Over-Permission (Azure)
A contributor role exposed multiple VMs to a compromised service account. Remediation included:
- Creating **custom RBAC roles**
- Enforcing **JIT Access** and access reviews using Azure PIM
