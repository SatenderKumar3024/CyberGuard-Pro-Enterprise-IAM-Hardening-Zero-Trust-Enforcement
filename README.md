# 🔐 CyberGuard Pro: Enterprise IAM Hardening & Zero Trust Enforcement

**Live Demo:** [View Project Live](https://kzmkgrouf78p29eh6alv.lite.vusercontent.net/)

---

## 📌 Overview

**CyberGuard Pro** is a security-first implementation designed to harden Identity and Access Management (IAM) across AWS and Azure environments. It enforces **least-privilege access**, **Zero Trust principles**, and **regulatory compliance (NIST 800-53)** — reducing access-related cloud vulnerabilities by **30%**.

---

## ⚠️ Problem → ✅ Solution Flow

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Over-permissive roles across 50+ cloud assets (S3, VMs) | Role review + RBAC implementation |
| Lack of consistent MFA and access auditing | Enforced MFA + Zero Trust |
| Compliance gaps (NIST AC-2, AC-6, AC-17) | Mapped IAM controls to compliance requirements |
| High operational friction with least-privilege enforcement | Maintained performance with scoped automation |

---

## 🛠️ Key Components

### 1. IAM Audit & Role Review
- Conducted audit of existing IAM roles across AWS and Azure
- Identified excessive permissions and unused privileges

### 2. RBAC & Policy Creation
- Created Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mappings
- Defined Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access rules for cloud operations

### 3. Zero Trust & MFA Enforcement
- Integrated Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts
- Applied Zero Trust principles: **Verify Explicitly**, **Assume Breach**, **Least Privilege**

### 4. Compliance Validation
- Mapped IAM design to:
  - AC-2: Automated account lifecycle management
  - AC-6: Enforced minimum necessary permissions
  - AC-17: Conditional access for remote sessions

## 🔐 Core Security Principles

- **Zero Trust Architecture** – Never trust, always verify
- **Least Privilege Access** – Users get only what they need
- **Microsegmentation** – Divide and control access per asset
- **MFA Everywhere** – Biometric or token-based verification
- **Continuous Monitoring** – Real-time security state validation

---

## 📊 Compliance Dashboard & Automation

- Developed real-time compliance monitoring dashboard
- Automated compliance reporting across:
  - NIST 800-53
  - ISO 27001
  - GDPR

> 🧠 **Result**: Reduced audit prep time by **35%** using automation and reporting APIs

---

## 💡 Key Outcomes

- 🔒 Reduced cloud identity-related vulnerabilities by **30%**
- 📈 Improved compliance posture across multiple frameworks
- ⚙️ Enabled secure scaling of IAM with automation and Zero Trust
- ⏱️ Delivered in under **6 weeks**
